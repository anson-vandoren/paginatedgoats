        <h2>What is this site?</h2>
        <p>
        I'm a software developer working at <a href="https://cribl.io" target="_">Cribl</a>
        and I occasionally need to test some of the data integrations we write
        against a throwaway REST server that will respond in predictable ways.
        This is just a simple public site that exposes a dummy API for myself
        and others on the team to easily test against.
        </p>
        <p>
        Also... I'm a domain name hoarder, and this was a convenient excuse to
        buy another one :P

        <h2>Other sites already do this...</h2>
        <p>
        Yep. But they don't have as cool of a domain name as this one does, and
        besides, I like coding and owning it myself - it keeps working unless
        I break something or stop paying the hosting/domain bill.
